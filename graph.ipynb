Main Topic\\n\\n**The Evolution of OpenAI: A Retrospective on the 2015 Vision vs. The 2024 Reality**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. & 3. Semantic Decomposition and Image Slide Plans\\n\\nHere is the breakdown of the text into semantic sub-topics, along with a plan for the visual design of each slide.\\n\\n**Slide 1: Title Slide**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** Introduction to the presentation topic.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A split-screen image. On the left, a vintage 2015-style computer terminal displaying \"OpenAI: Non-Profit Research Lab.\" On the right, a futuristic 2024 interface displaying \"OpenAI: Commercial AI Giant.\" A timeline arrow connects them. Title text overlaid: \"OpenAI: The 2015 Vision vs. The 2024 Reality.\"\\n\\n**Slide 2: The Genesis (2015)**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** OpenAI\\'s original launch announcement, emphasizing its non-profit status, mission for humanity, freedom from financial constraint, and openness, backed by a star team and $1B commitment.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A stylized image of a foundational charter document or scroll. The header reads \"OpenAI Founding Principles - Dec 2015.\" Below it, bullet points with icons: a handshake (Non-profit for Humanity), an open padlock (Openness: Papers/Code), a shield (Safety Focus), and a stack of money bag icons with text \"$1B Committed Funding.\"\\n\\n**Slide 3: Immediate Reactions: Excitement vs. Skepticism**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** The 2015 forum responses debating whether deep learning could actually achieve AGI, whether it would plateau, and if risk discussions were mere \"fear-mongering.\"\\n*   **Image Plan:** A visual tug-of-war or a balanced scale. On one side, labeled \"Excitement,\" icons of a brain lighting up and a rocket ship to represents potential AGI. On the other side, labeled \"Skepticism,\" a graph showing a line flattening out (the plateau) and an icon of a \"scarecrow\" labeled \"Fear-Mongering.\"\\n\\n**Slide 4: Early Philosophical & Ethical Debates**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** Deeper discussions discussing consciousness, the \"Chinese Room\" argument, and analogies contrasting AI risks with nuclear weapons or biological agents.\\n*   **Image Plan:** Broad, abstract imagery. A central image of Rodin\\'s \"The Thinker\" statue, surrounded by floating translucent symbols: a nuclear mushroom cloud, a DNA helix, a robot hand touching a human hand, and a question mark inside a brain outline (consciousness).\\n\\n**Slide 5: Prescient Premonitions (The 2015 Worries)**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** Early forum concerns that accurately predicted future issues: filter bubbles, AI-driven propaganda, and autonomous weapons.\\n*   **Image Plan:** Three distinct panels looking like blurry crystal balls coming into focus. Panel 1: A person isolated inside a bubble looking at a phone screen (Filter Bubbles). Panel 2: A megaphone icon churning out identical news headlines (Propaganda). Panel 3: A silhouette of a drone with a target reticle (Autonomous Weapons).\\n\\n**Slide 6: The Pivot: Structural Shifts (2019)**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** The major transition from pure non-profit to \"capped-profit\" (OpenAI LP) and the massive partnership with Microsoft for compute and cash, moving away from the original spirit.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A crossroads graphic. A small, fading dirt path goes straight, labeled \"Original Non-Profit Route.\" Beside it, a massive, paved multi-lane highway veers off to the right, labeled \"Capped-Profit & Microsoft Partnership ($13B+).\" A large Microsoft logo is visible at the start of the highway.\\n\\n**Slide 7: The Revolution Timeline (2019–2024)**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** The rapid progression of frontier models leading to mainstream adoption: GPT-2, GPT-3, DALL-E, and the explosion of ChatGPT.\\n*   **Image Plan:** An exponentially rising curve timeline. Markers along the curve: \"2019: GPT-2,\" \"2020: GPT-3,\" \"2021: DALL·E.\" At the top right peak, a large explosion icon labeled \"Nov 2022: ChatGPT Era\" with user count numbers \"100M+ Users.\"\\n\\n**Slide 8: Safety, Governance, and Turmoil**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** AI safety becoming a mainstream policy issue (EU AI Act), alongside internal OpenAI drama like the ousting/reinstating of Sam Altman and departures of key safety figures.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A chaotic boardroom scene. A large table with a gavel has a crack running through the middle. Scattered on the table are newspaper headlines: \"EU AI Act Passes,\" \"Altman Fired,\" \"Altman Returns,\" and \"Safety Leads Resign.\" A tension icon (tightrope) hangs above the scene.\\n\\n**Slide 9: The Fate of Openness**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** The shift from the promise of shared patents and open code to closed frontier models accessed only via APIs.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A \"Before and After\" contrast. On the left (labeled \"2015 Promise\"), an open treasure chest overflowing with documents labeled \"Open Source Code\" and \"Shared Patents.\" A green checkmark. On the right (labeled \"2024 Reality\"), a large black box vault with a glowing keyhole labeled \"API Access Only.\" A red \\'X\\' mark over it.\\n\\n**Slide 10: Hindsight: The Most Prescient Predictions**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** Highlighting 2015 predictions that correctly foresaw incremental scaling of deep learning, the rise of \"dialogue agents\" (LLMs), and algorithmic curation risks.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A digital bulletin board with three \"pinned\" animated index cards. Each card has an old-fashioned forum user avatar, a date (2015), and a quote.\\n    *   Card 1 (visarga): \"The next big things... decent dialogue agents.\" (Big Green Checkmark)\\n    *   Card 2 (glup): \"Rich models of natural language semantics.\" (Big Green Checkmark)\\n    *   Card 3 (Geee): \"AI to sort news/social feeds... propaganda.\" (Big Green Checkmark)\\n\\n**Slide 11: Hindsight: The Most Wrong Predictions**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** Highlighting 2015 predictions that drastically underestimated progress, claiming neural nets were \"stupid,\" that we were \"100 years too early,\" or comparing AI to stalled fusion research.\\n*   **Image Plan:** Similar bulletin board layout to the previous slide, but the cards are stamped with big red \"FAILED\" stamps.\\n    *   Card 1 (hacker_9): \"This is about 100 years too early... neural networks... are stupid.\" (Big Red X)\\n    *   Card 2 (scottlocklin): \"AI progress is a lot like progress in controlled nuclear fusion... aka, there is no such thing.\" (Big Red X)\\n    *   Card 3 (orthoganol): \"Nothing at all out there... on a trajectory [to AGI].\" (Big Red X)\\n\\n**Slide 12: Notable Ironies: Musk and Mission Drift**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** The retrospective view on Elon Musk\\'s shifting role from funder to suing critic targeting the mission drift, and how the original 2015 text now reads like an \"alternate timeline.\"\\n*   **Image Plan:** A split portrait of Elon Musk. The left half shown in 2015 attire with the text overlay \"2015 Co-Founder & Funder.\" The right half shown in current attire with a scowl and text overlay \"2024 Competitor & Plaintiff.\" Between them, a document icon labeled \"Original Mission\" is shown tearing in half.\\n\\n**Slide 13: Final Conclusion**\\n*   **Semantic Meaning:** Summary: OpenAI became the leading institution via deep learning scaling. AGI isn\\'t here yet, but powerful general-purpose models are, and safety is now a serious field.\\n*   **Image Plan:** A balanced final image. A large glowing brain icon labeled \"General Power Models (Here).\" Below it, two smaller icons: An unlocked padlock labeled \"AGI (Not Yet)\" and a shield with a gear icon labeled \"Safety Field (Serious Now).\" Text at the bottom: \"The decade deep learning went from research to revolution.\"',\n",

      "{'messages': [HumanMessage(content=\"Summary of the article and thread (brief)\\nArticle: OpenAI announces itself (Dec 2015) as a non‑profit AI research lab, “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” Mission: advance digital intelligence to benefit humanity; focus on openness (papers, code, maybe patents), and safety (“AI should be an extension of individual human wills… broadly and evenly distributed”). It’s explicitly deep‑learning‑oriented, with a star founding team (Sutskever, Karpathy, Kingma, Schulman, etc.), $1B in committed funding from Musk, Altman, Thiel, AWS, Infosys, YC Research, etc., and rhetoric about long‑term AI risks and benefits.\\n\\nThread themes:\\n\\nExcitement at the team and funding, plus jokes about the casual mention of $1B.\\nArguments over:\\nWhether deep learning / neural nets can lead to AGI or will plateau.\\nWhether AI risk talk is “fear‑mongering” or a prudent early start.\\nWhether OpenAI is really about safety vs just joining the deep‑learning arms race.\\nHow “open” it will actually be; discussions of datasets, code, competitions, visas.\\nComparisons with MIRI / FHI and “friendly AI” research; some calling MIRI a cult, others defending it.\\nPhilosophical side‑trips: consciousness, free will, Chinese Room, whether reasoning implies agency.\\nEthics of enslavement of AI vs animals; analogies with guns, nukes, nanotech, nitrogen, synthetic biology.\\nEarly versions of now‑familiar worries: filter bubbles, AI‑driven propaganda, autonomous weapons, job loss.\\nMeta‑digressions (H‑1B politics, “just, wow” as a phrase, NRA arguments, etc.).\\nWhat actually happened to this topic (with hindsight)\\nHigh‑level: OpenAI went from an idealistic non‑profit research lab to the most prominent commercial AI lab in the world, driving the LLM revolution and triggering global AI policy debates—while substantially walking back the original “non‑profit, open, unconstrained by financial return” framing.\\n\\nKey milestones (very condensed):\\n\\n2016–2018: open, research‑lab phase\\n\\nReleased Gym, Universe, baselines, “Spinning Up in Deep RL,” many papers and code.\\nWork on Dota 2 bots, robotics, unsupervised learning, language models (e.g., GPT, GPT‑2).\\nReputation as a high‑quality, relatively open deep‑learning lab.\\n2019: structural pivot\\n\\nCreated OpenAI LP, a capped‑profit subsidiary, explicitly to raise large capital while keeping a controlling non‑profit; a big shift away from the original “non‑profit only” spirit.\\nEntered a massive partnership with Microsoft, which over time invested on the order of $13B+ (compute, cash, integration with Azure).\\n2019–2021: frontier language models\\n\\nGPT‑2 (2019) and GPT‑3 (2020) showed surprisingly general capabilities across NLP tasks without task‑specific training.\\nGPT‑2’s “staged release” and GPT‑3’s closed weights marked the end of OpenAI’s strongest openness.\\nDALL·E and CLIP (2021) pioneered high‑quality image generation from text prompts.\\nLate 2022–2024: ChatGPT era\\n\\nChatGPT (Nov 2022) made LLMs a mainstream technology; usage exploded to hundreds of millions of users.\\nGPT‑4 (2023) demonstrated strong general‑purpose performance across coding, reasoning, and many benchmarks; integrated deeply into products (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.).\\nOpenAI became the central public face of “frontier AI”, widely perceived as being on or near the leading edge of “AGI‑like” capabilities.\\nSafety & alignment became big internal teams (policy, RLHF, red‑teaming), but also a major external criticism target (bias, hallucinations, misuse, race dynamics).\\nSafety, governance, and backlash\\n\\nAI risk—once “sci‑fi” in 2015—became a mainstream policy topic. The EU AI Act, US executive order on AI (2023), UK/US/EU safety summits, and national strategies all cite both short‑term harms and long‑term risk.\\n2023: Sam Altman briefly ousted by the OpenAI non‑profit board, then rapidly reinstated after staff and investor revolt, followed by board reshaping—a major governance drama directly about mission, safety, and control.\\n2024: key safety figures (e.g., Jan Leike, Ilya Sutskever) left; resignation letters and public comments suggested internal tension between safety caution and rapid deployment/commercialization.\\nOpenness vs closedness\\n\\nOpenAI still publishes papers and some code, but frontier models are API‑only. The original blog’s suggestion that patents would be shared and everything be generally open is no longer accurate.\\nOpen‑source frontier models came mostly from others (Meta’s LLaMA family, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, etc.), not from OpenAI.\\nMIRI & “friendly AI”\\n\\nMIRI continued doing very theoretical alignment work but became relatively peripheral compared to huge industry safety teams and new orgs (Anthropic, ARC, OpenAI’s alignment groups).\\nBy early 2020s, even mainstream ML leaders (Hinton, Bengio, Russell) publicly endorsed some level of existential‑risk concern, but the technical program is very different from MIRI’s original agenda.\\nNet: OpenAI did become a leading institution, and deep learning—especially large transformers—ended up being the core path. AGI in the strong, fully autonomous sense is still not here in 2025, but general‑purpose models with impressive breadth of capability clearly are, and AI safety is now a serious field rather than just sci‑fi talk.\\n\\n“Most prescient” and “Most wrong” comments\\nMost prescient\\n\\nvisarga – “I don't think evolving a super intelligence will happen by simple accident, it will be an incremental process of search… The next big things I predict will be capable robots and decent dialogue agents.”\\n\\nThe “incremental, search/engineering‑driven” trajectory is exactly what happened: continual scaling and refinement of deep models, not one magical accident.\\n“Decent dialogue agents” is dead‑on: ChatGPT and its peers are the signature AI product class of the early 2020s. Robotics is behind dialogue but clearly advancing (e.g., Tesla Optimus, Google/Agility/Boston Dynamics).\\nglup – “I'll wager RNNs in NLP given Ilya's background. Probably moving towards increasingly rich models of natural language semantics and pragmatics.”\\n\\nHe missed transformers vs RNNs, but predicted OpenAI’s early focus: Ilya + NLP and richer semantic/pragmatic language models. OpenAI’s GPT line is exactly “rich models of language semantics/pragmatics.”\\nGeee / camillomiller (on propaganda/filter bubbles)\\n\\nGeee worries about “AI to sort news/search/social feeds” and propaganda; camillomiller explicitly likens current recommender/filter bubbles to a “super intelligent centralized AI silently and invisibly deciding what's best for us to see.”\\nIn hindsight, algorithmic curation, engagement‑maximizing recommender systems and targeted content (YouTube/TikTok feeds, political micro‑targeting, etc.) became one of the major social impacts of ML.\\nrl3 – critical of Musk’s “give everyone AI” strategy; notes that if AGI is scalable, first arrival + scaling could still yield a dominant superintelligence and that treating it like universal empowerment is analogous to open‑sourcing nukes.\\n\\nThis maps well onto current debates: broad LLM access did not eliminate concentration of power; it coexists with massive centralized compute and closed frontier models, and many safety folks now argue for stronger controls rather than pure openness.\\nMost wrong\\n\\nhacker_9 – “This is about 100 years too early. Seriously why do people think neural networks are the answer to AI? They are proven to be stupid outside of their training data… This fear-mongering is pointless.”\\n\\nWithin 8–9 years, deep neural nets (scaled transformers) produced models with impressive generalization: transfer across tasks, in‑context learning, code synthesis, cross‑lingual capabilities, etc. Not “AGI”, but very far from “stupid outside training data.”\\nAI risk talk is now taken seriously by governments, major labs, and many ML pioneers; whether or not one agrees, calling it “pointless” aged poorly.\\nscottlocklin – “‘AI progress’ is a lot like progress in controlled nuclear fusion as an energy source. Aka, there is no such thing, really, though people work on it.”\\n\\nThe 2015–2024 decade is arguably the most dramatic period of practical AI progress in history; the comparison to fusion stagnation turned out to be almost comically wrong.\\northoganol – “In terms of artificial general intelligence… there is seemingly nothing at all out there that appears to even be on a trajectory, I mean even theoretically, to coming close. … I don't think the big breakthroughs… are going to come from well funded scientific researchers anyways, they are going to come out of left field from where you least expect it.”\\n\\nMajor breakthroughs in general‑purpose capability did come from exactly the kind of large, well‑funded labs (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic) he discounted, via fairly straightforward scaling of known architectures + tricks.\\nargonaut (on progress plateauing) – while correct about OpenAI being deep‑learning‑dominated, his claim that we’re “nowhere close to AI” and that hacky, poorly understood neural nets make breakthroughs unlikely and progress bound to plateau doesn’t fit the next decade, where scaling these “hacky” methods produced qualitatively new behaviors. Not AGI yet, but clearly beyond what 2015 expectations would have suggested.\\n\\nOther fun or notable aspects in hindsight\\nThe original “non‑profit, open, patents shared” promise now reads almost like an alternate timeline. Today OpenAI is a capped‑profit entity with a massive corporate partner, closed frontier models, and an aggressive product roadmap. The 2015 text is often quoted back at OpenAI critics as evidence of mission drift.\\n\\nElon Musk’s role: co‑chair and key funder at launch; later left the board (2018), publicly criticized OpenAI for becoming “closedAI,” and in 2024 filed a lawsuit alleging breach of its original non‑profit mission—then launched his own competitor (xAI). That arc is foreshadowed by his early “open AI for everyone” rhetoric in the linked Backchannel interview.\\n\\nMIRI / Yudkowsky discourse: 2015 commenters called MIRI a “cult” and “philosophers,” yet by 2023 several mainstream ML legends (Hinton, Bengio) voiced views closer to the original “AI x‑risk” concerns, and governments convened AI safety summits. MIRI itself didn’t become central, but the topic moved from fringe to center.\\n\\nThe “just, wow” linguistics micro‑thread and HN moderation meta‑discussion are a nice time capsule of 2015 HN culture (dang gently steering away from flamewars, users analyzing phrasing minutiae).\\n\\nEarly worries about AI‑driven surveillance and autonomous weapons (samstave, Udik, odkol, etc.) anticipate real 2020s debates: facial recognition in policing, drone swarms, “slaughterbots” campaigns, and export controls on surveillance tech.\\n\\nThe repeated guns/nukes analogies: a lot of the rhetoric now heard in policy circles—“like nukes, not like guns,” attacker vs defender advantage, first‑mover dynamics—was already being hashed out in this thread, just with far less context.\\n\\nFinal grades\\nFinal grades\\n\\nvisarga: A+ (nailed “decent dialogue agents” and an incremental, search-driven path to more capable AI)\\nglup: A- (correctly anticipated OpenAI focusing on richer NLP semantics/pragmatics, even if the architectures shifted from RNNs to transformers)\\nGeee: A (very early, accurate concern about AI-powered curation/propaganda and its societal impact)\\ncamillomiller: A (strong articulation of filter-bubble/recommender risks that became central in the 2020s)\\nrl3: B+ (good critique of “everyone has AI” as safety, foreshadowing current concerns about centralization and arms race dynamics)\\nastrofinch: A- (sophisticated attacker/defender equilibrium framing that matches today’s AI security debates)\\njohann28: B+ (solid, nuanced take on ML vs symbolic AI and realistic near-term misuse; much of it held up)\\nJach: B (accurate description of MIRI’s stance and the weak-AI vs AGI distinction; MIRI’s influence stayed niche but the conceptual split is now standard)\\nkarmacondon: B- (prescient about the importance of code+data, benchmarks, competitions; but “evil AI and safety… just science fiction” aged poorly)\\nnazgulnarsil: B+ (early use of “differential safety development” framing that’s now common in frontier-AI governance discussions)\\nHoushalter: B (right to emphasize the control problem and expert timelines; overconfident about how straightforward “building AI with infinite compute” would be)\\nmark_l_watson: B+ (correctly saw OpenAI as pushing cutting-edge research rather than a monolithic AGI framework like OpenCog)\\nnicklo: B+ (accurate contrast between OpenCog’s monolithic design and OpenAI’s “push the frontier, publish as you go” model)\\nbengpertzel: B+ (realistic view of OpenAI and OpenCog as complementary; correctly guessed OpenAI would fund varied AI work, not one grand unified design)\\nviklas: B+ (“giga-factory of neurons” plus a general model exposed via API is very close to the GPT-3/4 API world, minus the true open-sourcing)\\nrobbensinger: B+ (right that OpenAI and MIRI would talk and that safety would grow as a field, though MIRI remained peripheral)\\nargonaut: C+ (right about OpenAI’s deep-learning focus and lack of dedicated safety researchers at launch; significantly underestimated how far “hacky” deep nets would go and predicted a plateau that didn’t arrive—yet)\\northoganol: D (claimed nothing was on a trajectory to AGI and that big breakthroughs wouldn’t come from well-funded labs; OpenAI/DeepMind/Anthropic are counterexamples)\\nscottlocklin: F (asserted there was effectively no real AI progress, likening it to fusion; the following decade of LLM and generative-model breakthroughs flatly contradicted this)\\nhacker_9: F (confidently declared we were “100 years too early,” that neural nets are “proven to be stupid,” and that AI risk concerns are pointless; all badly undermined by subsequent progress and mainstreaming of AI safety debates)\\nstefantalpalaru: D (dismissed the whole thing as a PR stunt by people who “don’t understand AI”; whatever OpenAI’s flaws, its technical impact has been enormous)\\nzxcvvcxz: C- (correct that current systems could be misused in war/targeting; but the blanket dismissal of “Skynet/doomsday” risk as ridiculous underestimates how seriously many experts and policymakers now take long-term AI risk)\\ntim333: C (AI did not progress as “predictably” as implied and the “finite skill areas to tick off” framing missed the emergent generality of LLMs)\\nvonnik: B (insightful comparison of AI with guns vs nukes and the inevitability/irregulatability angle; still debated, but the framing holds up reasonably well)\\nOverall interestingness\\nArticle hindsight analysis interestingness score: 10\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3f741fb6-1fb4-47b5-9bf8-1242a2bc89ad'), AIMessage(content='Here\\'s a slide plan based on the provided text, decomposing it into semantic meanings and outlining image ideas for each slide:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Slide Plan: The Evolution of OpenAI and AI Discourse**\\n\\nThis presentation will explore OpenAI\\'s journey from a non-profit research lab to a global AI leader, alongside the evolving public and expert discourse surrounding AI development and risks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Slide 1: Title Slide - The OpenAI Odyssey: From Idealism to Influence**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** Introduction to OpenAI\\'s founding vision and its journey.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A split image: on one side, a futuristic, utopian vision of AI benefiting humanity, possibly abstract or symbolic with gears and human silhouettes;

A subtle hint of a $1B funding pledge.\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 3: Early Debates: Hope, Skepticism, and Philosophical Quandaries**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** Key discussion themes from the original thread: AGI potential, AI risk, openness, and philosophical implications.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A collage or infographic-style image representing contrasting viewpoints: two figures debating over a \"neural network\" diagram, a \"danger\" sign next to a \"safe\" sign, an open lock vs. a closed lock, and thought bubbles containing philosophical symbols (e.g., a brain, a question mark, a circuit).\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 4: The Research Lab Phase (2016-2018): Open Foundations**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** OpenAI\\'s initial period of open research and releases (Gym, Universe, GPT-1/2).\\n*   **Image Idea:** An image showing a bustling, open-plan research lab with whiteboards full of equations, people collaborating, and screens displaying code. Tools like \"Gym\" and \"GPT-2\" could be subtly incorporated into the imagery, symbolizing foundation building and initial breakthroughs.\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 5: The Pivotal Shift: Capped-Profit & Microsoft (2019)**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** The transition to OpenAI LP and the strategic partnership with Microsoft.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A visual metaphor for a \"pivot\": a large compass needle swinging from \"Non-Profit\" to \"Capped-Profit.\" Two hands shaking against a backdrop of data centers or cloud computing, representing the Microsoft partnership and significant investment (e.g., $13B+).\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 6: Frontier Language Models Emerge (2019-2021): GPT-3 & DALL-E**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** The impact of GPT-2, GPT-3, DALL-E, and CLIP, marking a move towards closed models.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A visual timeline showing the progression from GPT-2 to GPT-3. The left side could depict a text-based interface transforming into a more sophisticated, creative output like a generated image (DALL-E) on the right. A symbol of a \"closed lock\" could appear as GPT-3 is introduced, contrasting with \"open\" symbols from earlier slides.\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 7: The ChatGPT Era: AI Goes Mainstream (2022-2024)**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** ChatGPT\\'s explosion in usage, GPT-4\\'s capabilities, and OpenAI\\'s status as a frontier AI leader.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A dynamic image depicting a surge of digital information or a network connecting millions of users to a central, glowing AI core. ChatGPT and GPT-4 logos could be integrated, along with symbols of coding, reasoning, and diverse applications.\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 8: Safety, Governance, and Backlash: A New Era of Scrutiny**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** The rise of AI risk as a policy topic, the\\n    Altman ousting, and internal tensions over safety.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A multi-faceted image: scales of justice or policy documents, a dramatic corporate boardroom scene (symbolizing the Altman drama), and a tug-of-war between two groups labeled \"Safety\" and \"Deployment/Commercialization.\"\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 9: Openness vs. Closedness: A Shifting Landscape**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** The shift from OpenAI\\'s initial open promises to its current closed-model strategy, contrasted with open-source alternatives.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A clear visual contrast: on one side, an open book or an overflowing data stream representing \"open-source.\" On the other, a secure, locked server or a closed box symbolizing \"proprietary API-only models.\" Logos of LLaMA and Stable Diffusion could appear on the \"open\" side.\\n*   **Image Request:** **Slide 10: The Evolution of MIRI and AI Alignment**\\n\\n*   **Sub-topic:** MIRI\\'s original role, its current peripheral status, and the mainstreaming of AI x-risk concerns by ML pioneers.\\n*   **Image Idea:** A small, niche-looking research group (MIRI) in the background, while a spotlight shines on mainstream ML leaders (represented by prominent figures looking thoughtful) discussing \"existential risk\" in a public forum.\\n*   **Image Request:** ', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='3dd97476-61eb-4f07-b64c-063eb1aee923')]}\n"
